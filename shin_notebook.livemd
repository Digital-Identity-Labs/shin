# Shin Workbook

```elixir
Mix.install([{:shin, ">= 0.1.0"}])
alias Shin.{Metadata, Attributes}
```

## 1. Defining an IdP

You'll need to change the URL to the base URL of your own IdP service. You'll need access
to the admin endpoints (by default this is done with an IP address allow-list)

```elixir
{:ok, idp} = Shin.idp("https://idp.university.ac.uk/idp")
```

## 2. Getting raw metrics information

```elixir
metrics = Shin.metrics(idp)
```
